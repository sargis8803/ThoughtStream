PROJECT OVERVIEW:

This current design is the implementation for the backend of a diary web application. ThoughStream is supposed to be an accessible platform 
built for users to record events in their life, stored in a remote database using mongodb atlas. 

Setup instructions: 

To test Thoughtstream, the following need to installed in the working directory of the application:
- npm init -y 
- npm install express mongoose dotenv cors axios
- npm install nodemon --save-dev

After packages are installed, simly run "npm start" in the command line to spin up the server

API Usage Guide:

List of endpoints:

GET /api/diary

GET /api/diar/:id

POST /api/diary

DELETE /api/diary/:id

PUT /api/diary/:id

Example request for GET /api/diar/:id, pass the path and port
Response: diary entry returend given id with 200 OK status
Response (on failiure): 500 status code since entry was not located


REQUIRED ENV VARIABLES:
- MONGO_URI
- WEATHER_KEY

KNOWN ISSUES:

Server spinning on port 5000 responds with 403 upon client connection request, this may be due problems with the testing machine
during implementation, in which case port 4000 worked
