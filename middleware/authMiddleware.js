// File: middleware/authMiddleware.js
// Middleware function to protect routes in the ThoughtStream app
// Ensures that only authenticated users can access certain API endpoints

/**
 * Middleware to check if a user is authenticated.
 *
 * Use Passport's req.isAuthenticated() method, which checks:
 * - Whether the user has an active session
 * - Whether req.user has been set by Passport - the user has logged in
 *
 * Apply this middleware to any route available to logged-in users only.
 * If the user is authenticated, the middleware calls next() to allow
 * the request to proceed. If the user is not authenticated, it returns a
 * 401 Unauthorized response.
 *
 * Example usage in a route:
 * router.get("/private", ensureAuthenticated, (req, res) => {
 *   res.send("This is a protected route");
 * });
 *
 * @param {object} req - Express request object, extended by Passport
 * @param {object} res - Express response object
 * @param {function} next - Function to pass control to the next middleware
 * or route handler
