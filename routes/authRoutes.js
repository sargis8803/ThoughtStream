 * @route GET /auth/google
 * @desc Initiates the OAuth2 login flow by redirecting the user to Google’s consent screen
 *
 * - This route is triggered when a user clicks Login with Google.
 * - The passport.authenticate("google", ...) middleware initiates the OAuth flow using the
 *   configured Google strategy
 * - The scope defines what data we want access to. In this case:
 *   - "profile": user's basic public info (e.g., name, picture)
 *   - "email": user's primary email address
 * - Google handles the login and asks the user for consent to share this information

 * @route GET /auth/google/callback
 * @desc Handles the OAuth2 callback from Google after the user logs in and consents.
 *
 * - Google redirects the user back to this route after login
 * - Passport takes over again to process the response and extract the user’s info
 * - If login fails (e.g., user denies consent), it redirects to /auth/failure
 * - If login is successful, a session is created automatically and the user is authenticated
 * - Replace res.send() with a redirect to a protected page (or frontend)

 * @desc Logs the user out by ending the session and clearing session cookies
 *
 * - req.logout() is provided by Passport and removes the req.user property

 * - Once logout completes, the user is effectively logged out of the application
 * - The session cookie will no longer be sent in future requests
